Junco is a split keyboard powered by Raspberry Pi Picos that I designed from scratch. The schematic and PCB were designed using KiCad and the case was developed in Blender. For firmware, I contributed to the popular open source <Anchor href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware" rel="external">QMK</Anchor> firmware that is written in C.

In my contribution to QMK, I went above basic support and added custom animations for the RGB lighting.
