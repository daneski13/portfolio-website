LinkedIn is an extremely popular platform for job seekers, making it one of the best websites to gather data on the job market.

To gather data from LinkedIn I developed a web scraper using Selenium WebDriver's Python bindings since LinkedIn uses JavaScript to render content after clicking the proper elements.

The scraper collects each listing's title, URL, company name, company's LinkedIn URL, the job's location, the description, seniority level, employment type (eg. Full Time, Part Time etc.), job functions, and the company's industries.
